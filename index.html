                Since I’ve dedicated the last few months teaching myself the basics of web development, I thought this application would be a good opportunity for me to practice some of the skills that I have learned so far. Since I was in the process of learning CSS grid while starting the application, I decided to design each section of the webpage to look like paintings from Mondrian–which proved to be a great exercise in solidifying my understanding of CSS grid. I am aware of the inconsistencies in my approach to creating the layout for each section–one section uses flexbox, others have nested grids, the final one is just one, single grid–but I believe these inconsistencies are a reflection of my learning process in using grid.
                <br><br>
                I designed this website so that each application question could be read in their intended order, so reading my questions from here shouldn’t detract from the readability of the application. I’ve also included some extra content for the sake of entertainment and to add some context. Please enjoy!

                        I started my professional career working as a budget analyst in Washington DC after I received my bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Virginia. Since this job was in a university, I worked alongside several professors who were truly passionate about teaching. I was so inspired by them that I started reading about the philosophy of education, which led me to Paulo Freire’s book “Pedagogy of the Oppressed.” This book was so convincing that it drastically changed my outlook on life and inspired me to become a teacher, which is my current profession.

                            It wasn’t until last year that I fully committed to learning programming–which I had only previously dabbled in–thanks to the urging of my roommate who was a data scientist. I started by writing my own algorithms, albeit very inefficient, for coding challenges on sites like Codewars. I remember the excitement I felt from challenging myself to solve problems and think in different ways. For the first time since college it felt like I was growing intellectually, thereby becoming a better version of myself. The satisfaction that I felt in myself from learning this new skill is what ultimately convinced me to change careers.

                            Since beginning this journey, I have taught myself concepts such as form creation and validation in HTML, flexbox and the grid layout in CSS and higher order functions, closures and recursion in Javascript. I have also started studying algorithms and data structures in order to write code more efficiently.

                        <p>Without a doubt my greatest accomplishment has been the personal guidance I have given to my students. Upon becoming a teacher, I had the mission of enhancing my students’ ability to think independently and critically. While this has continued to be a goal of mine throughout my career as an educator, I quickly realized that it only forms a fraction of a teacher’s “moral curriculum.” Other important qualities such as compassion, work ethic, tolerance, perseverance, self-expression, etc. have become pillars in my educational approach. The teaching of these qualities has taken form in several ways: from me leading discussions with students on International Women’s Day about the historical and present-day struggles of women, to me wearing a fairy costume on Halloween, which resulted in me unexpectedly coming out to my students, who were puzzled to see a man dressed as such.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>My mission as a teacher changed. What started as a mission to almost exclusively teach critical thinking skills turned into me attempting to become an exemplar of morality for them. This transformation into a role model caused me to scrutinize my own behaviors so that they would be in accordance with the expectations that I placed on my students. Because of this, teaching values is my ultimate accomplishment to date, not only because it induces desirable behavioral changes in my students, but also because it forces me to look at my own actions to ensure that I am personally living up to the standards I set for my students.</p>

                        Although I have found great satisfaction in my career as an educator, the low pay has left me in a position where I am living paycheck to paycheck without any savings and with lingering debts. This lack of financial stability has become an even greater issue lately since it is prohibiting me from caring for my mom and sister, who have basically become homeless in the past two months. Given my financial constraints and the lack of a robust support system, I find myself quite limited in how I can navigate the future, both during and after the bootcamp. Winning this scholarship would allow me to make the most out of the program, since it would provide me with the financial leeway to take out a personal loan live on my own, which would create a more conducive environment to learning than the one available at my grandmother’s house–which is currently occupied by my mom, sister, cousin and grandmother.

                    <div>Upon completing the bootcamp, my main objective will be to find a job as a full-stack developer and become self-sufficient so that I can help my mom get back on her feet. I believe working on both the front-end and back-end will expand upon my knowledge of the skills taught at Hack Reactor, while also providing me with an all-encompassing understanding of software product deployment. This will, in turn, position me to navigate an ever-changing industry while also providing me with the tools necessary to create my own projects and businesses.</div>

                        If I were not to receive this scholarship, my goals would remain the same, however, the means by which I attain them would change. Most notably, I would have to change my living situation by moving out of my current place and returning to my hometown, where I would stay at my grandmother’s house until I find a job. Although I would not have to pay rent, I would need to take out a personal loan to pay for food, health insurance, transportation expenses, etc. As far as the bootcamp costs are concerned, I would finance the entire program with another personal loan, since I do not have the means to partake in the program otherwise. By winning this scholarship I would be able to allocate all of the personal loan money exclusively to my living expenses, basically allowing me to continue living on my own while I study–which would create a more stable learning environment.

                        If I were not a recipient of this scholarship, I would have to forgo some of the financial and–in many ways–personal freedoms that I’ve grown accustomed to. I am, however, prepared for this since I understand just how important these skills are in achieving my goals. Not only do I view this opportunity as a gateway into a software development job, but also as a means of creating a solid, foundational understanding of programming–an invaluable skill that I will need to navigate an increasingly technologically-driven world and to pursue my future entrepreneurial endeavors.

                    Having spent most of my childhood struggling with my race and sexuality, I know very well how exclusive language can confine us and prevent us from being our authentic selves. I strongly believe that this aspect of my upbringing is what made me as sensitive and perceptive as I am today, which has played a pivotal role in me creating an inclusive, personal ecosystem.

                <div>
                    I attribute the creation of this ecosystem to two things: my direct critique of exclusive language and my creation of a safe space. Over the years I have gathered enough courage to respectfully call people out for making insensitive comments. This is a skill that I have had to practice a lot since becoming a teacher, and I’ve found that it effectively serves the purposes of educating the offender about the sensitivities of others while also empowering the targets of the remarks by showing them that they don’t have to accept snide remarks without protest. It also signals that they have an ally who is willing to listen to their grievances.

                <div></div>
                <div>
                    I believe an inclusive, professional environment is created in a similar way: by acknowledging the sensitivities of others and allowing for a safe space where people can freely express themselves. In my first job, I was a member of a Diversity Council, which initiated events designed to train staff on these matters. In future workplaces, I will continue to seek out such initiatives while also continuing to listen and support those who may feel excluded.
