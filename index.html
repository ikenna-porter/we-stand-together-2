                        I started my professional career working as a budget analyst in Washington DC after I received
                        my bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Virginia. Since this job was in a
                        university, I worked alongside several professors who were truly passionate about teaching. I
                        was so inspired by them that I started reading about the philosophy of education, which led me
                        to Paulo Freire’s book “Pedagogy of the Oppressed.” This book was so convincing that it
                        drastically changed my outlook on life and inspired me to become a teacher, which is my current
                        profession.

                            It wasn’t until the COVID lockdown, during which I had ample free time, that I dabbled in
                            programming. I remember the excitement I felt from challenging myself to solve problems and
                            think in different ways. For the first time since college it felt like I was growing
                            intellectually, thereby becoming a better version of myself. The satisfaction that I felt in
                            myself from learning this new skill is what ultimately convinced me to change careers.

                            Since beginning this journey, I have taught myself concepts such as form creation and
                            validation in HTML, flexbox and the grid layout in CSS and higher order functions, closures
                            and recursion in Javascript. I have also started studying algorithms and data structures in
                            order to write code more efficiently.

                            want to catapult my learning with Hack Reactor.

                        <p>Without a doubt my greatest accomplishment has been the personal guidance I’ve given to my
                            students. Upon becoming a teacher, I had the mission of enhancing my students’ ability to
                            think independently and critically. While this has continued to be a goal of mine throughout
                            my career as an educator, I quickly realized that it only forms a fraction of a teacher’s
                            “moral curriculum.” Other important qualities such as compassion, work ethic, tolerance,
                            perseverance, self-expression, etc. have become pillars in my educational approach. The
                            teaching of these qualities has taken form in several ways: from me leading discussions with
                            students on International Women’s Day about the historical and present-day struggles of
                            women, to me wearing a fairy costume on Halloween, which resulted in me unexpectedly coming
                            out to my students, who were puzzled to see a man dressed as such.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="vertical-line"></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>My mission as a teacher changed. What started as a mission to almost exclusively teach
                            critical thinking skills turned into me attempting to become an exemplar of morality for
                            them. This transformation into a role model caused me to scrutinize my own behaviors so that
                            they would be in accordance with the expectations that I placed on my students. Because of
                            this, teaching core values is my ultimate accomplishment to date, not only because it
                            induces desirable behavioral changes in my students, but also because it forces me to look
                            at my own actions to ensure that I am personally living up to the standards I set for my
                            students.</p>

                        Although I have found great satisfaction in my career as an educator, the low pay rate has left
                        me in a position where I am living paycheck to paycheck without any savings and with debts that
                        equate to half of my annual income. Given these financial constraints, I find myself quite
                        limited in how I can navigate the future, both during and after the bootcamp. I believe that
                        with the scholarship I would be able to make the most out of my time at the bootcamp, since it
                        would provide me with the financial freedom to take out a personal loan to create a more stable
                        living situation.

                    <div>Upon completing the bootcamp my first objective would be to find a job as a full-stack web
                        developer. I believe a job in this field would solidify and expand upon my understanding of the
                        skills taught in the bootcamp. After a couple of years in web development, I would either choose
                        to stick with it, or use the skills I’ve learned on working on the front end and back end to
                        transition into other professions in tech. I believe two interesting alternatives to web
                        development are security engineering and cloud engineering. In fact, one of the reasons I’m
                        interested in this particular bootcamp is because of its inclusion of Python in its curriculum,
                        which would allow me to expand into other fields in IT, such as the two aforementioned ones.
